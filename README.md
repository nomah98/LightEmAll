LightEmAll Game

LightEmAll is a partner project created by Noah Rochefort and Oliver Hu in Fundamentals of Computer Science II at Northeastern University. 
The game involves creating a gameboard with mostly randomly generated rotatable pieces at different suare cells on the gameboard. The
pieces can be rotated by a user clicking on the desired piece. The goal of the game is to move around a "powerstation" denoted by a red star
which will give "power" to the board pieces that are connected. The win condition involves lining up all of the pieces correctly and placing
the powerstation on the correct piece. The content of the game is contained within src/part3.java. The game uses a Deque which was implemented
in src/Deque.java
